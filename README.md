# go-tinytime
A tiny time object in Go. Tinytime uses **4 bytes** of memory vs the **24 bytes** of a standard `time.Time{}`

A tinytime only supports dates from `1970` to `2106`. It uses a unix timestamp as a `uint32`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
go get github.com/wagslane/go-tinytime
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```golang
package main

import (
    tinytime "github.com/wagslane/go-tinytime"
)

func main(){
    tt, err := tinytime.New(1585750374)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err.Error())
    }
    
    tt = tt.Add(time.Hour * 48)
    fmt.Println(tt)
    // prints 2020-04-03T14:12:54Z
}
```

## Need More Date Ranges? Go-TinyDate

Unix timestamps only supports dates from `1970` to `2106`.
If you need a larger date range, take a look at [go-tinydate](https://github.com/wagslane/go-tinydate) which uses `day-month-year` underneath. Keep in mind go-tinydate doesn't support more than `day` precision.

## Why?

If you don't have resource constraints, then don't use tinytime! Use the standard [time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) pacakge.

go-tinytime works well in the following situations:

* You're okay with only to-the-second precision
* You're working in embedded systems where memory is a luxury
* You're storing many dates and smaller memory footprint is desired
* You're 101% sure you don't need a date range larger than 1970-2106

## API

Godoc: https://godoc.org/github.com/wagslane/go-tinytime

Tinytime mirrors the [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/) API for the most part. The only methods that are *not* included are the ones that makes no sense without timezone support.

## Formatting 

All formatting is done via the time.Time package's formatting capabilites.

## Transient Dependencies

None! And it will stay that way, except of course for the standard library.

Note: Currently the testify package is used **only** for testing, but that dependency will be removed in coming updates.
